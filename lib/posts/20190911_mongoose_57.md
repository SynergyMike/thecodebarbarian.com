[Mongoose 5.7.0](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose/blob/master/History.md#570--2019-09-09) was released on September 9 and is packed with new features. One major highlight
is that [Mongoose 5.7 supports the newly released MongoDB 4.2](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/compatibility.html), which means [transactions on sharded clusters](https://www.mongodb.com/collateral/mongodb-4.2-guide-to-what-is-new). In this article, I'll cover two other major improvements: conditionally [immutable properties](http://thecodebarbarian.com/whats-new-in-mongoose-5-6-immutable-properties.html) and much faster [document arrays](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/subdocs.html).

Conditionally Immutable Properties
----------------------------------

[Mongoose 5.6 introduced immutable properties](http://thecodebarbarian.com/whats-new-in-mongoose-5-6-immutable-properties.html), which are properties that cannot change after the document is stored in the database.

```javascript
const Model = mongoose.model('Test', new Schema({
  createdById: {
    type: Number,
    immutable: true // Mark `createdById` as immutable
  }
}));

const doc = await Model.create({ createdById: 1 });

// Trying to modify `createdById` is a no-op
doc.createdById = 2;
doc.createdById; // 1
await doc.save(); // Doesn't change `createdById`

// Also does nothing since `createdById` is immutable
await Model.updateOne({}, { createdById: 2 });
```

However, immutability in Mongoose 5.6 was all or nothing: either a property
was immutable for all instances of a model, or it wasn't. With Mongoose 5.7,
you can set the [`immutable` option](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api/schematype.html#schematype_SchemaType-immutable) to a function that takes the document as a parameter. For example, this means you can make a field immutable based on a user's `role`:

```javascript
// Only an admin can modify the number of credits they have
const User = mongoose.model('User', new Schema({
  numCredits: {
    type: Number,
    default: 0,
    immutable: doc => doc.role !== 'ADMIN'
  },
  role: {
    type: String,
    default: 'USER',
    enum: ['USER', 'MODERATOR', 'ADMIN'],
    immutable: true
  }
}));

const user1 = await Model.create({ role: 'USER' });
user1.set({ numCredits: 25 });
user1.numCredits; // 0

const user2 = await Model.create({ role: 'ADMIN' });
user2.set({ numCredits: 25 });
user2.numCredits; // 25
```

Faster Document Arrays
----------------------

In Mongoose 5.6.0, we overhauled Mongoose's [array class](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api/array.html) to use [ES6 array inheritance](http://thecodebarbarian.com/the-80-20-guide-to-javascript-arrays.html#subclassing-the-array-class) as opposed to mixins. In [some rudimentary benchmarks this resulted in a 20% performance improvement](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose/issues/7798). This change was long overdue: [ES6 introduced the ability to subclass the built-in `Array` class](https://github.com/wesbos/es6-articles/blob/master/54%20-%20Extending%20Arrays%20with%20Classes%20for%20Custom%20Collections.md), which enables faster custom array classes. In Mongoose 5.7.0, we [refactored the document array class to use ES6 array inheritance as well](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose/pull/8037).

For example, consider the below script that creates a document array with 100 elements, each with 5 keys, 5000 times.

```javascript
'use strict';

const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const subdocs = 100;
const reps = 5000;

const SubdocSchema = mongoose.Schema({ a: String, b: String, c: String, d: String, e: String  });
const Schema = mongoose.Schema({ name: String, subdocs: { type: [SubdocSchema] } });
const Model = mongoose.model('Test', Schema);
const data = {
  _id: new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(),
  name: 'test',
  subdocs: Array(subdocs).fill({a: 'a', b: 'b', c: 'c', d: 'd', e: 'e' })
};
const model = new Model();

for (let i = 0; i < reps; i++) {
  model.init(data);
}
```

Mongoose 5.7 is about 35% faster than Mongoose 5.6 on the above script.

```
$ npm install mongoose@5.6
+ mongoose@5.6.13
added 26 packages in 3.167s
$ time node test.js 

real	0m10.878s
user	0m11.444s
sys	0m0.293s
$ 
$ npm install mongoose@5.7
+ mongoose@5.7.0
added 1 package, removed 1 package and updated 1 package in 0.648s
$
$ time node test.js 

real	0m6.940s
user	0m7.087s
sys	0m0.053s
$ 
```

Moving On
---------

Conditionally immutable properties and faster document arrays are just 2 of the
9 new improvements and features in Mongoose 5.7.0. We also introduced MongoDB
4.2 support, middleware for query validation, and a [`Query#get()` function](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api/query.html#query_Query-get). Make sure you
upgrade to take advantage of all the new features!
