For the last 5 years, I've been using [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/homepage/) to send all my transactional
emails. Mailgun's API is easy to work with, and their UI has excellent logging that makes it easy to figure out
whether an email was actually sent. Here's how you can get started with Mailgun and Node.js.

Your First Email
----------------

Once you sign up and [get a Mailgun API key](https://signup.mailgun.com/new/signup), the first thing Mailgun
shows you is how to send a test email to yourself from the command line with [curl](/what-javascript-developers-should-know-about-curl.html).

Try running the curl command and you should get a sample email that looks like what you see below. Note that
the email is from a Mailgun sandbox domain. Mailgun makes it easy to send emails from one of your domains as
well, but the sandbox is sufficient for testing.

Sending emails from Node.js is easy using Mailgun's official [mailgun-js npm module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mailgun-js). Run `npm install mailgun-js` and you should be able to run the below script to send a sample
email. Just make sure to set your `domain` and `apiKey` to the correct values.

```javascript
const apiKey = 'your api key here';
const domain = 'your domain here';

const mailgun = require('mailgun-js')({ domain, apiKey });

mailgun.
  messages().
  send({
    from: `test@${domain}`,
	  to: 'your email here',
	  subject: 'Hello from Mailgun',
	  text: 'This is a test'
  }).
  then(res => console.log(res)).
  catch(err => console.err(err));
```

Templating and Styles
---------------------

Plain text emails are fine for a simple test, but what about sending pretty HTML emails? There are a few nuances
with HTML emails that you should be aware of:

- Styles must be inlined, because not all email clients support style tags. In other words, you can't use CSS classes with emails, you must do `<div style="...">` for all your HTML elements.
- Images cannot be SVGs, because many email clients donâ€™t support SVG, including Gmail.
- Different clients render emails differently, so you need to test on multiple clients.

In particular, designing emails with inlined CSS styles gets a bit cumbersome. The [inline-css npm module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inline-css) is great for converting `style` tags into inline styles before sending your email.
Below is an example of using `inline-css` to compile HTML with `style` tags into something email-friendly.

```javascript
const inlineCSS = require('inline-css');
const mailgun = require('mailgun-js')({ domain, apiKey });

const template = `
<div>
  <style>
    h1 { color: green; }
  </style>

  <h1>Hello, World</h1>
</div>
`;

run().catch(err => console.log(err));

async function run() {
  const html = await inlineCSS(template, { url: 'fake' });

  await mailgun.messages().send({
    from: `test@${domain}`,
	  to: 'your email here',
    subject: 'Hello from Mailgun',
    html,
	  text: 'Hello, World'
  });
}
```

The `inline-css` module has a couple quirks. First, it is async, because it supports dereferencing remote
styles defined using `<link href="...">`. Second, it requires a `url` option, but if you're just using it
to process an inline `style` tag, you can put a placeholder value.

There are numerous options for templating HTML emails, like [Pug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pug) or [Handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/handlebars). These days I prefer [using Vue for email templating](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/masteringjs/issues/building-and-testing-email-templating-using-vue-257729).
The [vue-server-renderer npm module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-server-renderer) makes it easy to convert
a Vue app to HTML from Node, with no transpilers required. Below is an example of combining Vue and `inline-css`
to create an HTML email with templating and inline styles.

```javascript
const inlineCSS = require('inline-css');
const mailgun = require('mailgun-js')({ domain, apiKey });
const { renderToString } = require('vue-server-renderer').createRenderer();
const Vue = require('vue');

const template = `
<div>
  <style>
    h1 { color: green; }
  </style>

  <h1>{{message}}</h1>
</div>
`;
run().catch(err => console.log(err));

async function run() {
  const app = new Vue({
    data: () => ({ message: 'Hello, World' }),
    template
  });

  let html = await renderToString(app);
  html = await inlineCSS(html, { url: 'fake' });

  await mailgun.messages().send({
    from: `test@${domain}`,
    to: 'your email here',
    subject: 'Hello from Mailgun',
    html,
    text: 'Hello, World'
  });

  console.log('Sent!');
}
```

Attachments
-----------

Mailgun also makes it easy to send attachments. Easy attachments is why I use Mailgun to send confirmation
emails for my [eBooks](https://masteringjs.io/ebooks/mastering-mongoose). For example, suppose you want to
send an [epub](https://thecodebarbarian.com/creating-epub-files-with-node-js.html) of the classic novel
_Moby-Dick_ as an email attachment. To add an attachment, all you need to do is set the `attachment` property
to the path to the file you want to attach.

```javascript
await mailgun.messages().send({
  from: `test@${domain}`,
  to: 'your email here',
  subject: 'Hello from Mailgun',
  html,
  text: 'Hello, World',
  // Adding an attachment is as easy as putting a path to the file
  attachment: './moby-dick.epub'
});
```

For multiple attachments, you can set the `attachment` property to be an array of file paths:

```javascript
await mailgun.messages().send({
  from: `test@${domain}`,
  to: 'your email here',
  subject: 'Hello from Mailgun',
  html,
  text: 'Hello, World',
  // Multiple attachments
  attachment: ['./moby-dick.epub', './mastering-mongoose.pdf']
});
```

For more sophisticated attachments, you can also send a [Node.js buffer](/an-overview-of-buffers-in-node-js.html)
as an attachment. Just make sure you create a new instance of `mailgun.Attachment` as shown below.

```javascript
await mailgun.messages().send({
  from: `test@${domain}`,
  to: 'your email here',
  subject: 'Hello from Mailgun',
  html,
  text: 'Hello, World',
  // Custom attachment with raw data stored in a buffer
  attachment: new mailgun.Attachment({
    data: Buffer.from('Hello, World'),
    filename: 'message.txt'
  })
});
```

From the Mailgun dashboard, you can get detailed logs about individual emails. For example, if you find the
above email in your Mailgun logs, you can see the raw email that was sent, including the HTML content
and the base 64 encoded attachment.

Moving On
---------

I've used numerous tools for sending emails, like Amazon SES and Mailchimp. Mailgun is by far my preferred choice:
simple API, great logging, and helpful support. Next time you find yourself needing to build out email infrastructure,
