[Mongoose 5.8.0](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose/blob/master/History.md#580--2019-12-09)
was released on December 9, 2019. 5.8.0 is a [semver](https://semver.org/) minor version,
which means it introduces several new features. There are 15 new features in Mongoose 5.8.0,
ranging from a pre-compiled browser bundle to several index management improvements. In
this article, I'll cover two of my favorite new features: the `Schema#pick()` function
and improved stack traces for [server selection timeout errors](https://scalegrid.io/blog/understanding-mongodb-client-timeout-options/).

The [`Schema#pick()` Function](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api/schema.html#schema_Schema-pick)
----------------------------

The `Schema#pick()` function is analagous to [Lodash's `pick()` function](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#pick) for Mongoose schemas. Given a 
schema, `pick()` creates a new schema with a subset of the original schema's
paths.

For example, given a schema with 3 paths, `name`, `email`, and `age`,
the `pick()` function lets you create a new schema with just `name`
and `age`.

```javascript
const schema = new Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  email: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  age: {
    type: Number,
    required: true
  }
});

const newSchema = schema.pick(['name', 'age']);

newSchema.path('name'); // SchemaString { ... }
newSchema.path('age'); // SchemaNumber { ... }

newSchema.path('email'); // undefined
```

The newly created schema's paths have the same options for the picked paths.
In `newSchema` above, `name` and `age` are both required, just as
they are in `schema`.

The `Schema#pick()` function also works on [nested paths](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html#definition). For example, suppose you store `name` as an object,
with `first` and `last` as nested properties:

```javascript
const schema = new Schema({
  name: {
    first: {
      type: String,
      required: true
    },
    last: {
      type: String,
      required: true
    }
  },
  email: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  age: {
    type: Number,
    required: true
  }
});
```

Given this `schema`, you can create a schema that just contains all the
sub-properties of `name`:

```javascript
const newSchema = schema.pick(['name']);

newSchema.path('name.first'); // SchemaString { ... }
newSchema.path('name.last'); // SchemaString { ... }

newSchema.path('age'); // undefined
```

Or, you can create a schema that just contains `age` and `name.first`:

```javascript
const newSchema = schema.pick(['name.first', 'age']);

newSchema.path('name.first'); // SchemaString { ... }
newSchema.path('age'); // SchemaNumber { ... }

newSchema.path('name.last'); // undefined
```

Better Stack Traces for "Server Selection Timed Out After..." Errors
--------------------------------

The [`useUnifiedTopology` option](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/connections.html#options)
for Mongoose connections significantly changes how the underlying MongoDB driver
handles connections. Here's a brief summary:

- Before `useUnifiedTopology`, the MongoDB driver handled connectivity loss differently depending on whether you were connected to a [single server](/managing-connections-with-the-mongodb-node-driver.html#handling-single-server-outages), [replica set](/managing-connections-with-the-mongodb-node-driver.html#replica-set-outages), or sharded cluster. Furthermore, the behavior was slightly different depending on whether you hadn't connected yet, the connection was interrupted, or you had explicitly disconnected.
- With `useUnifiedTopology`, the MongoDB driver has a single algorithm for trying to send an operation to a server, regardless of topology and regardless of whether that operation is an initial connection, a query, or an index build. That process is called _server selection_, and if server selection times out, you get a `MongoTimeoutError`.

The major downside of a unified algorithm with only one type of error is how
hard it is to figure out what caused the error. With JavaScript, the problem
is even worse unless you have [async stack traces](/async-stack-traces-in-node-js-12).
For example, by default this is the error message and stack trace you get
when server selection times out:

```
MongoTimeoutError: Server selection timed out after 250 ms
    at Timeout.setTimeout [as _onTimeout] (/mongoose/node_modules/mongodb/lib/core/sdam/server_selection.js:309:9)
    at ontimeout (timers.js:436:11)
    at tryOnTimeout (timers.js:300:5)
    at listOnTimeout (timers.js:263:5)
    at Timer.processTimers (timers.js:223:10)
```

You get the same message and stack regardless of whether this error occurred due
to `mongoose.connect()` or `Model.find()` or `Model.syncIndexes()`. For example,
below is one script that prints the above error message:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// Fails because `baddomain` isn't a valid hostname.
mongoose.connect('mongodb://baddomain:27017/test', {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
  serverSelectionTimeoutMS: 250,
  bufferCommands: false
}).catch(err => console.log(err));
```

Below is another, different script that prints the same error message and
stack trace:

```javascript
const Server = require('mongodb-topology-manager').Server;
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

run().catch(err => console.log(err));

async function run() {
  // Start a MongoDB server on port 27000 and connect Mongoose to it
  let server = new Server('mongod', {
    port: 27000,
    dbpath: './27000'
  });

  await server.start();

  await mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27000/test', {
    useNewUrlParser: true,
    useUnifiedTopology: true,
    serverSelectionTimeoutMS: 250
  });
  const Model = mongoose.model('Test', mongoose.Schema({ name: String }));

  // Try to execute a query when the MongoDB server is down
  await server.stop();
  await Model.findOne().exec();
}
```

As a side note, `MongoTimeoutError` instances have a [`reason` property that tells you why server selection timed out](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/connections.html#server-selection).

In Mongoose 5.8, if you execute a query using `.exec()`, you get a more useful
stack trace when a `MongoTimeoutError` occurs. Assuming the above script
is contained in a file `script.js`, below is the stack trace you'll see.
The first entry in the stack trace is the line in `script.js` that calls
`exec()`.

```
MongoTimeoutError: Server selection timed out after 250 ms
    at new MongooseTimeoutError (node_modules/mongoose/lib/error/timeout.js:22:11)
    at Function.Model.$wrapCallback (/node_modules/mongoose/lib/model.js:4778:19)
    at utils.promiseOrCallback (/node_modules/mongoose/lib/query.js:4358:21)
    at Promise (/node_modules/mongoose/lib/utils.js:283:5)
    at new Promise (<anonymous>)
    at Object.promiseOrCallback (/node_modules/mongoose/lib/utils.js:282:10)
    at model.Query.exec (/node_modules/mongoose/lib/query.js:4357:16)
    at run (/script.js:26:25)
```

Note that you **must** explicitly call [the `Query#exec()` function](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api/query.html#query_Query-exec),
using `await Model.findOne()` isn't enough to get the full stack trace.

Moving On
---------

`Schema#pick()` and better server selection timeout errors are just 2 of
the 15 new features in Mongoose 5.8.0. Mongoose 5.8 also includes a
[`Model.validate()` function for validating POJOs](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api/model.html#model_Model.validate), [customizable `CastError` messages](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api/schematypeoptions.html#schematypeoptions_SchemaTypeOptions-cast),
and [`enum` for numbers](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#schemanumberoptions_SchemaNumberOptions-enum). You can find the
full list on the [Mongoose changelog](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose/blob/master/History.md#580--2019-12-09). Make sure you upgrade to
take advantage of all the new features!
