[Zip files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_\(file_format\)) are a common format for compressed files and folders.
Most developers end up using [tarballs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_\(computing\)) instead of zip files. But there are certain
cases where you are required to use zip files, like [uploading a function to AWS Lambda](https://thecodebarbarian.com/bundling-a-node-js-function-for-aws-lambda-with-webpack). In this article, I'll demonstrate how to use the
[adm-zip npm module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/adm-zip) to create and extract zip files.

Creating a Zip File
-------------------

The adm-zip npm module exports an `AdmZip` class. [An instance of `AdmZip` corresponds to a zip file](https://github.com/cthackers/adm-zip/wiki/ADM-ZIP). To create a new zip file, call `new AdmZip()` with no arguments:

```javascript
const AdmZip = require('adm-zip');

const file = new AdmZip();
```

There are several ways you can add files and directories to `file`. You can add files and directories from your
file system by name using `file.addLocalFile()` and `file.addLocalFolder()`. For example, below is how you can
add a `package.json` file and a `node_modules` directory to a zip file:

```javascript
const AdmZip = require('adm-zip');

const file = new AdmZip();

file.addLocalFile('./package.json');
// The 2nd `node_modules` param is the path to the directory in the zip.
// Without the 2nd param, every dir in `./node_modules` will be a top-level
// directory in the zip file.
file.addLocalFolder('./node_modules', 'node_modules');
```

You can then write the file using one of two methods: either by converting the zip file to a [Node.js buffer](/an-overview-of-buffers-in-node-js) using `toBuffer()`, by using `file.writeZip()`.

```javascript
// One way to write the zip file: convert it to a buffer and use `fs`
const fs = require('fs');

fs.writeFileSync('output.zip', file.toBuffer());

// Another way to write the zip file: `writeZip()`
file.writeZip('output.zip');
```

Once you write the `output.zip` file, you should be able to open it in your zip utility of choice. Below is what
the file looks like in [engrampa](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man1/engrampa.1.html), Xubuntu's default
archive manager.

The 2nd parameter to both `addLocalFile()` and `addLocalFolder()` is the path to put the file, or the directory's contents,
in the zip. For example, if you want to put both `package.json` and `node_modules` underneath a `project` directory,
you can run the below script:

```javascript
const AdmZip = require('adm-zip');

const file = new AdmZip();

file.addLocalFile('./package.json', 'project');
file.addLocalFolder('./node_modules', 'project/node_modules');

const fs = require('fs');

fs.writeFileSync('output.zip', file.toBuffer());
```

You can also add a file from a raw Node.js buffer using the `file.addFile()` method. For example, here's how you
can add a text file containing the string 'Hello, World' to your zip file, without actually creating a file on
your file system.

```javascript
const AdmZip = require('adm-zip');

const file = new AdmZip();

file.addFile('hello.txt', Buffer.fromString('Hello, World'));

const fs = require('fs');

fs.writeFileSync('output.zip', file.toBuffer());
```

Working with Existing Files
---------

If you pass a parameter to the `AdmZip` constructor, adm-zip will parse the file at the given path. For example,
below is how you can extract everything from the `output.zip` file to the directory `output`.

```javascript
const AdmZip = require('adm-zip');

const file = new AdmZip('./output.zip');

file.extractAllTo('./output');
```

You can also extract individual files from the zip file using `file.extractEntryTo()`. For example, here's how
you can pull out the `hello.txt` file from the zip file and write it to the current directory:

```javascript
const AdmZip = require('adm-zip');

const file = new AdmZip('./output.zip');

file.extractEntryTo('hello.txt', './');
```

You can use `addLocalFile()`, `addLocalFolder()`, and `addFile()` with existing files as well.

Moving On
---------

For better or for worse, zip files are commonly used for compression. Some services, like AWS Lambda, require you to
work with zip files. Thankfully, the adm-zip npm module makes it easy to create and extract zip files directly from
Node.js.
