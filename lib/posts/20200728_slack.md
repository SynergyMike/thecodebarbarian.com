Integrating with the [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/) is becoming an increasingly common task. Slack is the de facto
communication platform for many companies, so there's a lot of demand for getting data from Node.js apps to Slack
in realtime. In this article, I'll explain the basics of how to send a Slack message from Node.js.

Getting Started
---------------

There are two npm modules that I recommend for working with the Slack API: the [official `@slack/web-api` module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@slack/web-api) and the [`slack` module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/slack) written primarily
by [Brian LeRoux of WTFJS fame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et8xNAc2ic8). I've also used [node-slack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-slack) in the past, but that module is fairly out of date. However, both `@slack/web-api` and `slack` are
fairly thin wrappers around the Slack API, so, for the purposes of this article, we'll just use [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios).

In order to make an API request to Slack, you need a Slack token. There are [several types of Slack token](https://api.slack.com/authentication/token-types), each with its own permissions. For example, an [OAuth](/oauth-with-node-js-and-express.html) token
lets you post messages on behalf of a user. But, for the purposes of this article, I'll be using [bot user tokens](https://api.slack.com/authentication/token-types#bot). Bot user tokens let you post messages as a bot user, with a custom name
and avatar, as opposed to as an existing user.

In order to get a bot user token, you first need to [create a new Slack app](https://api.slack.com/apps). Make sure
you set "Development Slack Workspace" to the Slack Workspace you want to use.

Next, go through the steps to create a bot user. You'll have to add _scopes_ (permissions) to your bot user, and then
install your app. First, make sure you add the following scopes to your bot user:

- `chat-write`
- `chat-write.customize`
- `chat-write.public`

<img src="/images/slack-scopes.png" class="inline-image" />

Once you've added the above scopes, click "Install App" to install this new Slack app to your workspace. Once you've
installed the app, Slack will give you a bot user token:

Making Your First Request
-------------------------

To send a message to a Slack channel, you need to make an HTTP POST request to [the `https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage` endpoint](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage) with your Slack token in the [authorization header](https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/axios/authorization). The POST request body must contain the `channel` you want to post to, and the `text`
of your message.

Below is how you can send a 'Hello, World' message with Axios. Note that you must have a `#test` channel in your Slack
workspace for the below request to work.

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const slackToken = 'xoxb-YOUR-TOKEN_HERE';

run().catch(err => console.log(err));

async function run() {
  const url = 'https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage';
  const res = await axios.post(url, {
    channel: '#test',
    text: 'Hello, World!'
  }, { headers: { authorization: `Bearer ${slackToken}` } });

  console.log('Done', res.data);
}
```

If the request is successful, the response will look something like what you see below:

```
{
  ok: true,
  channel: 'C0179PL5K8E',
  ts: '1595354927.001300',
  message: {
    bot_id: 'B017GED1UEN',
    type: 'message',
    text: 'Hello, World!',
    user: 'U0171MZ51E3',
    ts: '1595354927.001300',
    team: 'T2CA1AURM',
    bot_profile: {
      id: 'B017GED1UEN',
      deleted: false,
      name: 'My Test App',
      updated: 1595353545,
      app_id: 'A017NKGAKHA',
      icons: [Object],
      team_id: 'T2CA1AURM'
    }
  }
}
```

And you should see the below message show up in your `#test` channel.

Because of the `chat-write.customize` scope, this bot can customize the name and avatar associated with this message.
For example, you can set the `username` and `icon_emoji` properties to customize the user your messages come from
as shown below.

```javascript
const res = await axios.post(url, {
  channel: '#test2',
  text: 'Hello, World!',
  username: 'Test App',
  icon_emoji: ':+1:'
}, { headers: { authorization: `Bearer ${slackToken}` } });
```

Below is how the above message looks in Slack.

More Sophisticated Features
---------------------------

You can send plain text messages, but Slack allows you to add formatting to messages using a [custom formatting language called mrkdwn](https://api.slack.com/reference/surfaces/formatting). Slack's mrkdwn language is conceptually similar to [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). Most notably, mrkdwn supports code samples in much the same way markdown supports code snippets:

```
- `foo` with backticks makes "foo" an inline code block.
- Multi-line code blocks are fenced with three backticks ```
```

But there are also several important differences:

- `*foo*` makes foo **bold** in mrkdwn, as opposed to _italic_ in markdown. To make text italic in mrkdwn, you should do `_foo_`.
- To make the substring "Google" link to `https://www.google.com/` in mrkdwn, you need to write `<https://www.google.com/|Google>`
- Mrkdwn does **not** support custom HTML. Any HTML is valid Markdown, but not mrkdwn.

For example, here's how you can send a message with some basic formatting, including a code block.

```javascript
const url = 'https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage';

const text = `
Check out this *cool* function!

\`\`\`
${hello.toString()}
\`\`\`
`;

const res = await axios.post(url, {
  channel: '#test',
  text,
  username: 'Test App',
  icon_emoji: ':+1:'
}, { headers: { authorization: `Bearer ${slackToken}` } });
```

Here's what the above message looks like:

Slack also supports more sophisticated layouts via [blocks](https://api.slack.com/reference/surfaces/formatting#block-formatting).
Instead of specifying a message's `text`, you can specify a `blocks` array. There are several different [types of blocks](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks#section), including a generic `section` block and an `image` block for pictures.

For example, below is a simplified example of sending a notification that a new order came in to an eCommerce platform, including
a qr code image.

```javascript
const res = await axios.post(url, {
  channel: '#test',
  blocks: [
    {
      type: 'section',
      text: { type: 'mrkdwn', text: 'New order!' },
      fields: [
        { type: 'mrkdwn', text: '*Name*\nJohn Smith' },
        { type: 'mrkdwn', text: '*Amount*\n$8.50' },
      ]
    },
    {
      type: 'image',
      image_url: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/QR_code_for_mobile_English_Wikipedia.svg/1200px-QR_code_for_mobile_English_Wikipedia.svg.png',
      alt_text: 'qrcode'
    }
  ],
  username: 'Test App',
  icon_emoji: ':+1:'
}, { headers: { authorization: `Bearer ${slackToken}` } });
```

Below is what the above message looks like in Slack.

Moving On
---------

Once you get a bot token, working with the Slack API from Node.js is fairly straightforward. You can send neatly formatted
messages to Slack to notify them of events they might be interested in, whether they be coworkers at your company or
clients using one of your products.
