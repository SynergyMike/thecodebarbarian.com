[Mongoose 5.5](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose/blob/master/History.md#550--2019-04-08) was released earlier this week. This release includes 12 new features and a [performance improvement](https://twitter.com/mongoosejs/status/1116360293981069312). The two features I'm most excited about are hooks for [user-defined static functions](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html#statics) and the ability to pass a function to [populate's `match` option](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#query_Query-populate). In this article, I'll introduce these two new features and show how they can save you some design headache.

Hooks for Custom Statics
------------------------

[Statics](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html#statics) are Mongoose's implementation of [OOP static functions](https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/fundamentals/static).
You add a static function to your schema, and Mongoose attaches it to any model you compile with that schema.

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const schema = new mongoose.Schema({ name: String });

// `findByName` is a static function. `this` is the model in this context.
schema.statics.findByName = function(name) {
  return this.find({ name });
};

const User = mongoose.model('User', schema);
User.findByName('test'); // Equivalent to `User.find({ name: 'test' })`
```

Mongoose 5.5 introduces the ability to add hooks for custom statics, like
`schema.pre('findByName')`. In a custom static's middleware function, `this`
is the model, like [`insertMany` middleware](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/middleware.html#types-of-middleware).

```javascript
// Can define pre and post hooks for `findByName` in Mongoose 5.5
schema.pre('findByName', function(next, name) {
  // Prints "User.findByName('test')"
  console.log(`${this.modelName}.findByName('${name}')`);
  next();
});
schema.post('findByName', function(docs) {
  // Prints "Found 0 docs"
  console.log('Found', docs.length, 'docs');
});

// Compile the model and run `findByName()`
const User = mongoose.model('User', schema);
User.findByName('test').
  then(() => console.log('done')); // Hooked `findByName` returns a promise
```

Statics help you consolidate core business logic into reusable functions.
Hooks for statics lets you handle
[cross-cutting concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-cutting_concern)
that affect all your statics. This is especially powerful when combined with
[plugins](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/plugins.html). For example, here's how
you can add [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) logging to all your
statics:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const debug = require('debug')('mongoose:statics');

// Create schema
const schema = new mongoose.Schema({ name: String, email: String });

schema.statics.findByName = function(name) {
  return this.find({ name });
};
schema.statics.findByEmail = function(email) {
  return this.find({ email });
};

// Add debug hooks for every static
Object.keys(schema.statics).forEach(name => {
  schema.pre(name, function(next, arg) {
    debug(`${this.modelName}.${name}(${arg})`);
    next();
  });
});

// Use the model
(async () => {
  await mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/test', { useNewUrlParser: true });
  const User = mongoose.model('User', schema);

  await User.findByName('test'); // Prints "mongoose:statics User.findByName(test) +0ms"
  await User.findByEmail('test@test.co'); // Prints "mongoose:statics User.findByEmail(test@test.co) +10ms"
})();
```

Populate Match Function
-----------------------

The [`match` option for populate](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/populate.html#query-conditions)
lets you add an additional filter to `populate()`. For example, suppose you
have two models, `BlogPost` and `Comment`, and you're using
[soft deletes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose-delete) for comments.
When you load a blog post, you want to load the corresponding comments that
do not have the `deleted` property set. Here's how you would ensure that
`populate()` always ignores `deleted` comments.

```javascript
// Create schemas
const blogPostSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: String,
  authorId: Number
});
blogPostSchema.virtual('comments', {
  ref: 'Comment',
  localField: '_id',
  foreignField: 'blogPostId',
  // When populating comments, exclude comments that have `deleted`
  // set to `true`
  options: { match: { deleted: { $ne: true } } },
});

const commentSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  _id: Number,
  blogPostId: mongoose.ObjectId,
  authorId: Number,
  deleted: Boolean
});
```

The `match` option lets you filter out `deleted` comments. But how about a
trickier challenge: finding all self-comments. That is, comments whose
`authorId` is equal to the corresponding blog post's `authorId`? Below is
an example of populating `comments`, excluding soft-deleted comments and
comments by anyone other than the author of the blog post.

```javascript
const BlogPost = mongoose.model('BlogPost', blogPostSchema);
const Comment = mongoose.model('Comment', commentSchema);
  
let post = await BlogPost.create({ title: 'Mongoose 5.5.0', authorId: 1 });
await Comment.create([
  { _id: 1, blogPostId: post._id, authorId: 2 },
  { _id: 2, blogPostId: post._id, authorId: 1 },
  { _id: 3, blogPostId: post._id, authorId: 1, deleted: true }
]);

post = await BlogPost.findOne().populate({
  path: 'comments',
  // If match is a function, it receives the blog post doc as a parameter
  match: doc => ({ authorId: doc.authorId, deleted: { $ne: true } })
});
console.log(post.comments.length); // 1
```

Internally, Mongoose relies on the excellent [Sift](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sift)
library to power match functions.

Match functions are particularly useful when it comes to roles and hiding results
the end user doesn't have permission to see. For example, suppose you want only
the author of the blog post to see deleted comments. Here's how you can
do that with match functions:

```javascript
const authorId = 1
post = await BlogPost.find().populate({
  path: 'comments',
  match: doc => (doc.authorId === authorId ? {} : { deleted: { $ne: true } })
});
```

Moving On
---------

Hooks for custom statics and populate match functions are just two of the 12
new features in [Mongoose 5.5](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose/blob/master/History.md#550--2019-04-08).
Some of the other new features are [connection-scoped plugins](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#connection_Connection-plugin), hooks for [`Query#distinct()`](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#query_Query-distinct), and the new [`Query#projection()` function](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#query_Query-projection). Make sure you upgrade and take advantage of all the new features in Mongoose 5.5!
